# Top 10 Rated AI Movies
Python, Jupyter Notebook
<br/><br/><br/>

In this notebook, we will list the top 10 rated AI movies based on their rating. We will modify and use the Bayesian average method for calculating the rating for each movie with the tag "artificial intelligence" by taking the average rating, number of user ratings, and tag relevance score. Movies are rated and tagged by users of the MovieLens website.

Run the following commands in your terminal to run this notebook:

git clone https://github.com/sinisabubonja/aimovies.git <br/>
python3.6 -m venv aimovies <br/>
cd aimovies <br/>
source bin/activate <br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br/>
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=Python4DS <br/>
jupyter notebook <br/>

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows you (among other things) to select which notebook to open. In the Notebook Dashboard, navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. When you open a Notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell at a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
